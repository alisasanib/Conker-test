## About Project

It's a recipe website that has been developed as the frontend test for Conker company.

Althoug it was not necesary to create APIs, I developed two endpoints to make it more professional. First one is for fetching all recipes (`api/recipes/`), and second one is for fetching one specific recipe (`api/recipes/[id]`).


I also implemented search, include, and excule queries to filter recipes response based on the filtered values recieved from the user.

Hope you enjpoy working with it :)
